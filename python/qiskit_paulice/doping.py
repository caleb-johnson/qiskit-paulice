    r"""Dope a Clifford circuit with ``RZ`` rotations.

    Each candidate wire is classified by conjugating the ``Z`` generator of a rotation placed
    there through the surrounding Clifford gates
    (`arXiv:2607.25941 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.25941>`_, Sec. S1.3). Every wire segment
    is a candidate, and the reference's three pruning rewrites are iterated to a fixed
    point: remove a rotation that commutes with all previous rotations and back-propagates
    to a diagonal at the input (it acts trivially on :math:`|0^n\rangle`), or commutes with
    all following rotations and forward-propagates to a diagonal at the output (it is
    invisible to sampling); merge equal-generator pairs that commute with every rotation
    between them, keeping the earliest (the reference removes one at random). Each returned
    site therefore contributes an irreducible rotation, which injects magic for any
    non-Clifford ``angle``.

    A :class:`.CheckedCircuit` input restricts sites to payload wires where a ``Z`` error is
    undetected by every check (cf. :attr:`.CheckedCircuit.uncovered_paulis`), so all
    syndromes remain deterministic and post-selection is unaffected. A new
    :class:`.CheckedCircuit` with the same check metadata is returned.

    Args:
        circuit: The Clifford circuit to dope, or a :class:`.CheckedCircuit` whose spacetime
            code the doping must preserve. Barriers and terminal measurements are ignored;
            sites past a qubit's measurement are excluded.
        num_sites: Number of sites to dope, drawn uniformly from the valid sites;
            ``None`` uses every valid site. A drawn subset may itself be further reducible;
            pruned-away draws are redrawn until ``num_sites`` irreducible sites remain.
        wires: The candidate wires. ``"all"`` considers every wire segment;
            ``"after_entangling"`` only the wires directly following a multi-qubit gate,
            one per qubit per entangling layer, as in the reference; ``"before_entangling"``
            only the wires directly preceding one. The two entangling rules differ only in
            which side of the intervening single-qubit gates a rotation sits.
        angle: Rotation angle of every inserted ``rz``; the default :math:`\pi/4` is a
            ``T`` gate. ``None`` inserts ``rz(dope[i])`` at ``sites[i]`` instead: one
            template covers every doping configuration (:math:`\pi/4` = ``T``,
            :math:`\pi/2` = ``S``, :math:`\pi` = ``Z``, ``0`` = identity), and every
            assignment preserves the code of a :class:`.CheckedCircuit`.
        seed: Seed or generator for the random site selection.

    Returns:
            * **QuantumCircuit | CheckedCircuit** -- A copy of ``circuit`` with the rotations
              inserted
            * **list[Wire]** -- The doped wires, sorted by circuit position

    Raises:
        ValueError: ``circuit`` contains a non-Clifford instruction or a non-terminal
            measurement, ``wires`` is not one of the allowed values, ``num_sites`` is out
            of range, or no irreducible subset of that size could be drawn.
